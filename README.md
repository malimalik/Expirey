# Expirey

A flutter app that allows you to keep track of your food items' expiration dates and reports time until expiration in days.
The quantity of that particular item is also reported. 


# Why I did this project?
* I wished to create a multi-page application to solve a real world problem. 
* I wished to learn and get used to reading documentations and API files of programming languages. 
* Apply advanced Object Oriented Concepts I learned in my programming classes. 
* Apply Data Structures and Algorithms from my classes to a real world application. 
* Get used to handling a big (ish) projects with multiple files and produce clean, well documented code while solidifying my understand of the key OO principles and best practices.  

# The Important Bits

Here is where the app sets up all of the objects that hold the app together. This file returns a **```MaterialApp```** widget which is the root of the widget tree.  In the **```Widget build(BuildContext context) ```** method, the app returns a **`Scaffold`** Widget which holds the **`HomePage`** class as its **`body`** and the **`SideMenu`** class as its **`drawer`** attribute.
